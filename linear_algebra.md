# Linear Algebra

- Scalars: A scalar is just a single number, in contrast to most of the other objects studied in linear algebra, which are usually arrays of multiple numbers. We write scalars in italics. We usually give scalars lower-case variable names. When we introduce them, we specify what kind of number they are. For example, we might say “Let s ∈ R be the slope of the line,” while deﬁning a real-valued scalar, or “Let n ∈ N be the number of units,” while deﬁning a natural number scalar.
